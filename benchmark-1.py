"""
Criteria:
* fastest runtime processing
* handles big data without crashing

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3,
but could be very large) containing int_list.
The array is either entirely comprised of odd int_list or
entirely comprised of even int_list except for a single integer N.
Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

For example:

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160
